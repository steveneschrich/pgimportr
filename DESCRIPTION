Description: This library is one of a set of tools for managing tracking data
  associated with program grants (large, multi-project NIH grants). REDCap forms
  have been developed to allow data entry. This tool imports the REDCap data and
  with some data wrangling, converts it into reportable form as an R table with
  formatted text. A companion package (pgreportr) is used for filtering, summarizing,
  and other activities.
